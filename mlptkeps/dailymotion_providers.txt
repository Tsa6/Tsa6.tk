# Formatting Instructions
#
# Lines starting with a hash character (#) and lines that are completely blank
# are ignored, though hash characters can be used in positions other than the
# first character.
# Lines starting with an at sign (@) list a channel owner, whose channel will be
# searched for episodes.  This should not be the channels display name, but the
# unique internal name, present in the channels url.  There should be nothing
# other than the at sign (@) and channel name on that line, though the two may
# be separated by whitespace.
# Each line starting with a plus sign (+) should be followed by a
# regular expression.  This regular expression must have capture groups named s
# (the season number, an integer), ep (the episode of that season), and may
# optionally have a capture group named title, for the title of the episode.  If
# a title is not provided, the title of the dailymotion video will be used
# instead. For each video owned by the provided owners, each provided regular
# expression under that channel is applied.  If a match is found, it is reported
# as an available episode.
# Lines starting with a minus sign (-) followed by a regular expression indicate
# results that should be excluded, even if matched by a positive expresion.
# Line order does not matter, though it is recomended to illustrate which regexs
# are for which channel.
